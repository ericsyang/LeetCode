> **Reverse Words in a String**

<i class="icon-tags">Description: ReverseWords</i>
 
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Clarification:
What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
How about multiple spaces between two words?
Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.


> **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**

<i class="icon-tags">Description: Sorted Array</i>

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

> **Sqrt(x)**

<i class="icon-tags">Description: Sqrt</i>

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x.

> **Single Number **

<i class="icon-tags">Description: Single Number</i>

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

<i class="icon-pencil">Note</i>
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

> **Reverse Interger **

<i class="icon-tags">Description: Reverse Interger</i>

Reverse digits of an integer.

1. Example1: x = 123, return 321
2. Example2: x = -123, return -321

>**Two Sum**

<i class="icon-tags">Description: Two Sum</i>

Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2
